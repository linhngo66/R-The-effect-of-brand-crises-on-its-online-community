This is a part of my bachelor thesis, which looks into the effect of brand crises on brand's online community. The hypothesis I am trying to find an answer through this code is that: **The occurence of brand crisis has a negative effect on (1) online communityâ€™s sentiment and (2) volume of participation.**

To answer this hypothesis, my thesis looks into the specific case of Tinder. 

**Note:** My bachelor thesis is a group work of 3 other students and I. We have a bigger research question, which requires more than one study. The code right here is just a part of one of our study. However, this code is totally written by me, without the help of other students participated in the thesis.
